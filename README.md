### But how do I do X? ðŸ˜•
Often times we will get stuck, but don't worry the internet is full of lots of helpful articles.
However, to make life easy we will use a few reference implementations to guide us.

#### Ionic Conference App

The ionic conference app is a full featured app built by the ionic team which includes many
mobile apps features such as a sidemenu, tabs, modals and many more. You can use it to understand how to structure
the project and also how to build pages.

The idea would be to look at how they have done things and try and replicate it in this codebase.

#### Matt Raible 21 Points App
This is a full application with API access via REST and is a good example to look at when working with services.
In Angular unlike React we don't need redux as state can easily be propagated through service providers.

This project shows how to implement services and how you can consume them in your pages.

It's a recommended example to look at because it uses Spring Boot as a backend. Which FlameletLab also uses.
